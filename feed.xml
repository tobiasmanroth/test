&lt;p&gt;Instagram Stories quickly raised to success with more than 250 Million active daily users in one year of existence. Consequently Insta Stories are getting more and more important to brands and companies, especially to build a strong interaction and connection to their users and customers.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the Instagram Feed, where posts are sorted by an algorithm, the Story Elements are listed chronologically. With each single Story post the Story will be placed at the very first spot of all stories from a user’s subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/how-to-boost/ig-story.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ig story&quot; title=&quot;Instagram stories&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Stories are logistically challenging: Likewise from the content perspective (what to hell shall I post?) and the posting-process (when should I post with which filter?). Furthermore it’s only possible to post content that is not older than 24 hours. Pretty complex, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-production of Story Elements is hardly possible, or at least pretty laborious. Though well timed Story Posts would boost the views and impact of the whole Story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-boost-your-views&quot;&gt;How to boost your views&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chronological sort mechanism suggest to post new parts of the Story over several hours during a day, ideally in the morning (8am), the afternoon (2pm) and the evening (7pm). Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The afternoon-posts boost your morning-content, because the Followers that haven’t been active at the beginning of the day, click through your previous tabs, videos and pictures, until they reached the afternoon element you’ve just uploaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/how-to-boost/posting-schedule.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;posting schedule&quot; title=&quot;Schedule your posts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same principle works for the posts that you shoot out in the evening, that push the views for again your morning and consequently afternoon-posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results are compelling: Insta-Accounts that followed this posting-schedule could note a view-raise of 300%!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially for news publishers, who can give similar News updates as on broadcast, for online-shops and fashion-Labels, who could use their Stories as a never ending shopping channel like QVC, it is valuable to follow this idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-plan-your-insta-stories&quot;&gt;How to plan your Insta-Stories&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently you’ve got two options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You do it by hand. Therefore you need to prepare the pictures and videos on your desktop, the send them to you mobile phone (beware of the 24 hours limit!), set an alarm at the time you want to post the element, and finally post it into your Story.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You upload your pics and videos into &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.storrito.com/&quot;&gt;Storrito&lt;/a&gt;, edit and schedule the elements and the app automatically posts them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ourselves are enthusiastic Istagram Story fans and for us the whole planning and posting process was exhausting and annoying. With our tool we offer you to save time and nerves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instagram Stories have been extremely successful last year. Although they were said to be the dead Copy-Cat of Snapchat the actual user-numbers indicate a different picture. With more than 250.000.000 daily users (Instagram, August 2017) and about 7.000.000.000 (yes, there are a lot of zeros in this sentence) the facebook giant outperformes Snapchat by roughly 100.000.000 users (Business Insider, June 2017) – every day!
&lt;!--more--&gt;
That really is something to be savoured; Not only by Evan Spiegel, the Snapchat founder who denied to be bought by facebook for a lot of money, but also for all the marketeers that realize that stories are the connection from brand and user and backwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;instagram-stories--free-engagement&quot;&gt;Instagram stories – free engagement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than ⅓ of the most seen insta story content is provided by brands or agencies, more than 15.000.000 official business accounts are registered with Instagram and more than 1.000.000 businesses advertise actively on the platform (Segmenta Communications, August 2017).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But enough of the number-dropping – what’s really making Instagram stories valuable is that it’s a free platform to present your story to a huge audience either as a private person, influencer or business. No matter if you’re showing behind the scenes pictures of your concert, a “how to”-tutorial or answer questions of your followers, you are the one to decide what to show and can react on trends and consumers within seconds. As stories elements only last for 24 hours you are able to plan self-contained “story-packages” with a concept that underlines your qualities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/how-to-post/post-quality.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;Post Quality&amp;quot;&quot; title=&quot;Post quality is key&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-is-the-production-of-an-instargram-story-so-painful&quot;&gt;Why is the production of an instargram story so painful?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it, brands and agencies plan and schedule each single posting in advance. Whether it’s a facebook-quote, pinterest series or a nicely photoshopped picture for the Instagram feed, they need to be in total control of the way each single posting looks like. Instagram stories, likewise to Snapchat stories, only support fotos or videos that are on your mobile devices for not longer than 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those two limitations, the time-constraint and mobile focus, make it really, really hard to plan stories in advance. Obviously that’s intended by the social networks, but again, brands and agencies need to plan, schedule and post, ideally in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In real life the insta story element, each behind the scene video or Q&amp;amp;A session is cutted and finished through Finalcut or Photoshop, then sent to a mobile phone and finally posted by the Social Media Manager. What a procedure…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-were-solving-it-for-you&quot;&gt;How we’re solving it for you&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-future-of-stories&quot;&gt;The future of stories&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon it will be possible &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/31/16233416/instagram-stories-mobile-desktop-web-support&quot;&gt;to view Instagram stories in the desktop app&lt;/a&gt;. Surely the daily view-rate will benefit from that fact and rise enormously. But there are no plans to allow story-posting from the desktop – as said in the linked article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Instagram says it has no plans to let users upload photos or Stories from the desktop, so don’t hold your breath. Even though desktop uploads would be the true game changer, being able to use most of Instagram from the web means we’re pretty close to not requiring the Instagram app on our phone at all, especially if you’re mainly using it to view and share stories.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus it will stay complicated for brands, agencies, companies, instagramers, professional Social Media Users in general to arrange their story-elements. A problem that we aim to solve with Storrito.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding stories in general, Mark Zuckerberg might have a Master-Plan to combine all channels in one. A first sign: Soon it will be possible to import your insta story into Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
